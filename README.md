## lab1
- Implement neural network by hand craft ,include feed forward and backpropagation and so on...
- Back propagation is the most difficault part to hand craft

## lab2
- Play Puzzle Game 2048 in TD algorithm
- Use n-tuple network to reduce data volume

## lab3
- EEG classification ,use pytorch creat simple deep neural network to predict eeg signal 
- Use EEGNet, including Depthwise Separable Convolution = deepwise conv + separable conv

## lab4
- Practice ResNet18, ResNet50 and other network architectures
- Diabetic Retinopthy Detection (糖尿病所引發的視網膜病變), classify picture to 5 class

## lab5
- Conditional VAE For Video Prediction,use VAE for robotic arm future movement prediction
- Use reparameterization trick to improve model learning efficiency and performance
- dataset is quite big too, the most difficult lab in this course

## lab6
- Deep Q-learning(DQN) and Deep Determinstic Policy Gradient(DDPG),in a moon landing game enviroment, let the space ship landing security
- Deep Q-learning(DQN) Atari breakout game
- Use open source python libarary Gym
- A tradition control system problem and use Reinforcement learning to solve it

## lab7
- Conditional DDPM to generate the picture in specific condition
- Modify the UNet architecture in DDPM 
- clevr dataset
